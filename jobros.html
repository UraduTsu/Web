        <article id = "myArticle">&emsp;Gyro Zeppeli, born Julius Caesar Zeppeli is the deuteragonist of Steel Ball Run.
                                  Gyro is a master of the Spin hailing from the Kingdom of Naples. 
                                  He joins the Steel Ball Run race to win amnesty for a child he is assigned to execute. 
                                  His mastery of the Spin later allows him access to Ball Breaker.<br><br>
                                  &emsp;Gyro is a man of average to above-average height and medium to athletic build. 
                                  He has hair that reaches mid-back, light eyes, square patches of facial hair lining his jaw, and (in illustrations) often painted lips. 
                                  He either wears grills or has chiseled into prosthetic teeth the phrase "GO! GO! ZEPPELI".
                                  Gyro's basic outfit consists of a short-sleeved studded black leather coat, leather pants, and cowboy boots. 
                                  He wears a belt, the buckle of which bears a pair of hands pointing to his crotch, and at his hips a pair of special holsters for his Steel Balls. 
                                  He wears a wide-brimmed hat, with slits on the the crown and the brim that let light and air filter through. 
                                  Situated around the crown of his hat are a pair of slit goggles. Depending on the weather he may wear his goggles, in addition to a scarf.<br><br>
                                  Gyro is a cocky and flamboyant executioner marked by the harshness of life, who participates in the Steel Ball Run for the sake of a young boy.
                                  &emsp;Gyro initially appears as a cocky and aggressive contestant in the Steel Ball Run. 
                                  Unlike other competitors, Gyro looks to seize the first place aggressively, rushing ahead of everyone then fending off anyone who challenges him.
                                  He also has a tendency to take dangerous shortcuts.
                                  Gyro is a rude man, deriding the vast majority of those he meets with insults and mocking commentaries. <br><br>
                                  &emsp;Even with his closest friend Johnny Joestar, Gyro doesn't mince his words and sometimes argues with him. 
                                  Moreover, Johnny only made a lasting impression on Gyro through his dogged stubborness and otherwise looked down on him during their first meeting.
                                  The only person for which Gyro had any degree of respect is his stern father Gregorio Zeppeli. 
                                  Gyro's cockyness and rudeness extend to his fights, during which Gyro is prone to mock his enemies in some way or say something cocky. <br><br>
                                  &emsp;For instance, he openly mocked Mountain Tim's "ridiculous" hat.
                                  Gyro is particularly proud of his mastery of the Spin, a family technique involving the rotation and throwing of steel balls to various effects and hails the Spin as the acme of human skill,
                                  this pride is latter justified when the Spin proves to be able to defeat even the Stand Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap - Love Train.
                                  His method of teaching is improvisational, only instructing Johnny the basics of the Spin and introducing him to the Golden Rectangle when they were threatened by a new enemy.
